this is where we're building our curriculum<br><br>

<a href="https://jankeLearning.github.io/pathbook">pathbook</a>:  the gitbook that guides students through our content  <br>
organized by week.  <br>
each week page has links to the md's, code, and assessments.  also has a schedule and week theme  <br><br>

assessments:  assessments, no writing code.  google forms for now - for true release can just be md's <br><br>

content-md: the finished md's for the curriculum <br><br>

content-code:  the js's for the curriculum - code to study, exercises, and example projects <br><br>

to-process-into-code:  code samples we've accumulated.  to pick from for making content-code <br><br>

to-process-into-md:  resources and presentations to process into final md's <br><br> 

node-precourse:  the precourse we assign to Elium students <br><br>

devvingANDjavascript-OLD:  a fun first try at gitbook js curriculum <br><br>
